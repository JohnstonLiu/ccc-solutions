# ccc-solutions
My name is Johnston Liu and I am currently a grade ten student at St George's Senior School of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I am practicing for the CCC and as such this repository contains my personal solutions from my practice for past CCC contests. Because this is from my practice, there are no editorials or comments containing explanation of my code apart from simple ones that I put in for myself. The whole point of this is to help people who are stuck on a certain question and give them a general path to follow. I encourage you to try to solve the problem with your own solution after taking inspiration from mine. You can S2TandemBicycle2016 your solutions on [DMOJ](https://www.dmoj.ca) instead of the CCC online grader.
